# Binary-Table-Generator
tell me how many variables and i will generate a binary table for you!!
Copy and paste the .py file to your compiler and run it! will ask you how many variables you need, and you should be obliged to give the a number(that you need) that is any positive integer, then press enter. Once the deed is done, your table will be ready when it's done.
